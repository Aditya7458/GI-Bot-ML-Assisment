# GI-Bots-ML-Assisment

This repository contains code for an assignment related to Machine Learning using Graphical User Interface (GUI). Follow the steps below to use the code:

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the GitHub repository to your local machine. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Then, run the following command:

```
git clone: https://github.com/Aditya7458/GI-Bots-ML-Assisment/
```

## Step 2: Install Required Libraries

After cloning the repository, navigate to the cloned directory:

```
cd GI-Bots-ML-Assisment
```

Before running the code, ensure you have installed the required libraries. Open the `requirements.txt` file in the repository and note down the libraries listed there.

You can install these libraries by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will install all the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

Once you have installed the required libraries, run the code by executing the Python file in your terminal or command prompt:

```
python main.py
```

Replace `main.py` with the actual name of the Python file containing the code.

## Step 4: Follow the GUI Instructions

After running the code, a window titled "Data Preprocessing and Prediction" will appear. Follow the instructions provided in the GUI:

- Click the "Load Data and Preprocess" button to load and preprocess your data files.
- Click the "Save Submission Data" button to save the submission data to a CSV file.
- Click the "Visualize Word Embeddings" button to visualize the word embeddings from the 'x3' and 'x4' columns of your train data.
